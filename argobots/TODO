CODE
----

 * Performance evaluation and improvement.


TESTING
-------

 * Micro-benchmark codes need to be added.

 * More examples need to be added.


EXTERNAL PROJECTS
-----------------

 * Argobots is a very low-level threading and tasking model.  Other
   models such as qthreads should be implementable on top of argobots.
   We should provide a simple implementation of qthreads on top of
   argobots for demonstration purposes.

 * OpenMP over argobots will be useful to get legacy applications to
   utilize argobots transparently, though it's unlikely it'll be able
   to use all of argobots' capabilities.

 * MPI interoperability with argobots needs changes in the MPI
   implementation to learn how to yield within argobots threads.

 * Tasking frameworks (such as PTGE) that can use argobots to schedule
   tasks need to be implemented.
