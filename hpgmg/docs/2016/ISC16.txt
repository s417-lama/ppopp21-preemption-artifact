HPGMG: A Supercomputer Benchmark and Metric

The HPGMG project (hpgmg.org) develops the extreme-scale benchmark and metric - HPGMG - which is a compact, stand alone, conceptually simple, benchmark, modeled in many ways on HPL. HPGMG solves a system of linear algebraic equations; the metric is equations solved per second (HPL maps equations to floating operations to generate the familiar flops/sec metric). HPGMG solves a finite volume discretization of the Laplacian and uses an appropriate solution algorithm - the non-iterative form of multigrid (full multigrid). HPGMG is designed for use as both a ranking metric and an aid to computer designers for developing architectures, and to centers for configuring systems, that are well balanced with respect to general sparse applications. Two other benchmarks in this session, HPL and HPCG, are good proxies for dense linear algebra and stored matrix solver applications, respectively.

In this past year we have developed a fourth order accurate discretization that pressures architectures in several dimensions other than memory bandwidth, which is the only significant sensitivity of a well optimized version of the old second order method. We publish the list twice each year (during ISC and SC) and centers are encouraged to submit; see http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/PAR/research/hpgmg. We present the HPGMG list, which shows some rank reordering relative to the Top500 list, and includes the first GPU (MPI+OpenMP+CUDA) results running on Titan and Piz Daint.
